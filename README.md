1. PLS_gradients --> PLS with only one latent variable run on one gradient at a time. Two models: the first with diagnosis included as a behavioral variable and the second without including diagnosis.
2. PLS_gradients_noreg_age_gender --> Same as number one but instead of regressing out age and gender, they are included in the model as behavioral variables.
